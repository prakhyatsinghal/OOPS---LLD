# OOPS---LLD

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects" which can contain data and code that can interact with each other. It is a way of organizing and designing software programs to make them more modular, flexible, and reusable.

There are four fundamental concepts of OOP, known as the "four pillars of OOP":

Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the process of grouping related data and functions into a single unit called a class. This helps to hide the implementation details from the user and provides a clean interface for working with the object.

Inheritance: Inheritance is the mechanism by which one class inherits the properties and behaviors of another class. This allows for code reuse and promotes code organization and modularity.

Polymorphism: Polymorphism is the ability of objects to take on multiple forms or behaviors. It allows for the same code to be used with different types of objects, which makes it easier to write reusable code.

Abstraction: Abstraction is the process of reducing complex systems into simpler and more manageable components. It allows for the essential features of a system to be captured in a simple model that can be easily understood and modified.

There are also several types of OOP languages, such as:

Class-based: These languages use classes to define objects and their properties and methods. Examples include Java, C++, and Python.

Prototype-based: These languages use prototypes to define objects and their properties and methods. Examples include JavaScript and Lua.

Object-based: These languages have objects but do not support inheritance. Examples include Visual Basic and VBScript.

Aspect-oriented: These languages use aspects to define cross-cutting concerns such as logging, security, and transaction management. Examples include AspectJ and Spring AOP.
