Encapsulation is a fundamental concept of object-oriented programming that helps to hide the internal workings of an object from the outside world. It is achieved by bundling related data and methods into a single unit called a class, and by using access modifiers to control access to the class members.


In this example, we have a class called Person that has two private instance variables, name and age. We also have two public methods, getName and getAge, that allow us to retrieve the values of these variables, and two public methods, setName and setAge, that allow us to set the values of these variables.

By making the variables private, we prevent them from being accessed directly from outside the class. Instead, we provide public getter and setter methods that allow us to access and modify the variables in a controlled way.
