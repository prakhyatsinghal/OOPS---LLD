    Difference between Inheritance and Polymorphism

    Inheritance - 1. Mechanism of allowing a new class to use properties and methods of a subclass.
    2. Implementation of inheritance occurs in class level.
    3. Provides Code reusability.

    Polymorphism -  1. Ability of a object to behave in multiple ways.
    2. Implementation of polymorphism occurs in method level.
    3. Allows calling methods at compile time and runtime.
